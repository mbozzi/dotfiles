"Is that SC State?"

"I keep trying and falling, because falling is easy -- but it
only takes you down."

"There is always going to be a difference between who you are and
who you want to be.  Progress is always in one direction.  While
you fail to move as fast as you can in that direction, you are
failing to live."

"What actually scares me?  I am told all sorts of things about fear.  Even now,
I'm tempted to lie to myself.  I suppose the only thing to do is
find out the answer for myself.

It's fucking terrifying.

Aah, the predicament of life.  Each of us are novices; none of us
have completed a life and lived to tell about it.  Such a very
visceral, human problem: one that I can only express as weak,
safe words.

Perhaps I can't express my fear as so visceral in words because
it isn't -- perhaps it's just conflated emotion within everything
that really doesn't matter."

"All that remains is to convince myself of the fact that I should
enjoy being scared."

"Isn't language cool?"

"But smile, my friend.  I know you better than most -- maybebetter than all.
You're just a human.  Take your life as it comes and enjoy it.
It's your only one, and you're stuck here.  It is only temporary.
If you go to these things, you will be thankful that you did.

I will not promise you now nor never.  Go see for yourself."

unwillingness to think about the question, or unwillingness to
answer honestly."
