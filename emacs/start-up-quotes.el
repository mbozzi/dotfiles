"\"If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said
'faster horses.'\"
  -- Henry Ford"

"Is that SC State?"

"I keep trying and falling, because falling is easy -- but it
only takes you down."

"There is always going to be a difference between who you are and
who you want to be.  Progress is always in one direction.  While
you fail to move as fast as you can in that direction, you are
failing to live."

"All that remains is to compel myself to enjoy being scared."

"Isn't language cool?"

"Definite answers are expected excepting the case of an unknown
fact.  In other cases, indefinite answers indicate either
unwillingness to think about the question, or unwillingness to
answer honestly."

"The time in which I write... has a horribly swollen belly, it
carries in its womb a national catastrophe... Even an
ignominious issue remains something other and more normal than
the judgment that now hangs over us, such as once fell on Sodom
and Gomorrah... That it approaches, that it long since became
inevitable: of that I cannot believe anybody still cherishes the
smallest doubt.... That it remains shrouded in silence is uncanny
enough.  It is already uncanny when among a great host of the
blind some few who have the use of their eyes must live with
sealed lips.  But it becomes sheer horror, so it seems to me,
when everybody knows and everybody is bound to silence, while we
read the truth from each other in eyes that stare or else shun a
meeting.

Germany... today, clung round by demons, a hand over one eye,
with the other staring into horrors, down she flings from despair
to despair.  When will she reach the bottom of the abyss?  When,
out of uttermost hopelessness --- a miracle beyond the power of
belief --- will the light of hope dawn?  A lonely man folds his
hands and speaks: \"God be merciful to thy poor soul, my friend,
my Fatherland!\""

"We empower them -- they do not control us.

If you want peace, cultivate peace in your house.  If you want
respect, respect others.

You have it in in your power with every thought, relationship,
investment, and action to immediately and permanently change your
world."

"Lucky girl
on board a ship."

"If you want respect, respect others.  If you want peace, then
cultivate peace in your house.  If you want war, well...."

"Do I deserve retribution from aggrieved people whose lives have
been ruined by actions my leaders have taken without my consent?"

"Let mistakes be made.  But forgive them."

"Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity."

"Don't walk behind me: I may not lead.  Don't walk in front of
me; I may not follow.  Just walk beside me and be my friend."

"Did you see the sky that night?  It wasn't the drugs.  It wasn't
you."

"A bag of skin whose contents are flesh and blood and bone.  A
bag of skin on a speck of dust in swirling infinity."

"Everybody's situation is the same, all equally valid, regardless
of breadth of experience or your own personal opinion.  Some of
us are more innocent, but that doesn't mean that what they feel
matters any less or that their naivet√© indicates they don't feel
as sharply as anyone else."

"What has to go through someone's mind to compel them to drive a
truck into a crowd of hundreds of celebrating people, crushing
them in the streets?"

"Perhaps god is the greatest, but if I am supposed to do this,
then I want no part of it."

"Can somebody reconcile the demands of religion with the reality
of life?"

"It seems to me that anything that does this is necessarily
self-consistent with our perception of the world and ourselves.
True faith is not belief in something you're simply told, but
trust in the truth of what you percieve.  Belief clings, but
faith is a plunge."

"The present phase of human thought and history... almost compels
us to face reality with open minds, and you can only know God
through an open mind just as you can only see the sky through a
clear window.  You will not see the sky if you have covered the
glass with blue paint."

"We must here make a clear distinction between belief and faith,
because, in general practice, belief has come to mean a state of
mind which is almost the opposite of faith.  Belief, as I use the
word here, is the insistence that the truth is what one would
\"lief\" or wish it to be.  The believer will open his mind to
the truth on the condition that it fits in with his preconceived
ideas and wishes.  Faith, on the other hand, is an unreserved
opening of the mind to the truth, whatever it may turn out to be.
Faith has no preconceptions; it is a plunge into the unknown.
Belief clings, but faith lets go.  In this sense of the word,
faith is the essential virtue of science, and likewise of any
religion that is not self-deception."
